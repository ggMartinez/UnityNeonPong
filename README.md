# Neon Pong
This is a Unity Project to implement Pong, with lot of Neon Effects. 

I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZvNFrS7wTM&t=131s) as a reference and inspiration, and as an assets source. I started using some code from the video, and then re-architectured for my own.

I implemented an Game Event System instead of having all GameObjects calling between themselves, using my [Custom Package](https://github.com/ggMartinez/Unity-Event-System-Package) to implement Game Events

Also used a Sound manager that I borrowed for a [project I worked on a GameJam](https://texadev.itch.io/milkshake) with my friend [TEXADev](https://texadev.itch.io/). Go check out his stuff. He is an excellent game maker.

Lots of stuff used for assets (I'm a programmer, not a graphical artist, and besides I'm a musician, don't have time to compose and record right now) :
* Sparks/Explosion effect from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qeNu2QApAM)
* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZvNFrS7wTM&t=131s) as a reference, and as an asset source. I started using some code from the video, and then re-architectured for my own.
* Better scene management using [this guide](https://blog.unity.com/engine-platform/achieve-better-scene-workflow-with-scriptableobjects)
* Background music (Royalty free) from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Em2QM1QtQQ)

Feel free to play and use.
