# Neon Pong
This is a Unity Project to implement Pong, with lot of Neon Effects.

Lots of stuff done and used here:
* My [Custom Package](https://github.com/ggMartinez/Unity-Event-System-Package) to implement Game Events
* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZvNFrS7wTM&t=131s) as a reference, and as an asset source. I started using some code from the video, and then re-architectured for my own.
* Better scene management using [this guide](https://blog.unity.com/engine-platform/achieve-better-scene-workflow-with-scriptableobjects)
* Sound manager that I borrowed for a [project I worked on a GameJam](https://texadev.itch.io/milkshake) with my friend [TEXADev](https://texadev.itch.io/). Go check out his stuff. He is an excellent game maker.
* Background music (Royalty free) from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Em2QM1QtQQ)


Feel free to play and use.
